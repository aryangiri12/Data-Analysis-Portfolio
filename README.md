# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
🚀 Project Completed!
I'm excited to share that I’ve successfully completed the “SQL for Data Analysis Full Portfolio Project with Practical [1 Hour] | End-to-End SQL Project 2024”!

This project gave me hands-on experience in using SQL for real-world data analysis, where I worked through the entire data analysis lifecycle—from importing datasets and cleaning data, to writing complex queries for insights and generating meaningful business conclusions.

Key highlights of the project included:
✅ Writing optimized SQL queries
✅ Performing JOINS, CTEs, subqueries, and aggregations
✅ Deriving actionable insights from raw data
✅ Creating a structured, portfolio-ready report

This was a great opportunity to strengthen my SQL skills and build an end-to-end project that reflects how data is used to drive decisions in industries today. I’m looking forward to applying these skills in more advanced analytics and real-world problem-solving!
